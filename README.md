This project focuses on predicting user ratings based on collaborative filtering using the scikit-surprise library. The ratings data is sourced from the `ratings.csv` file from IMDb.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a recommendation system that can predict user ratings for movies based on collaborative filtering techniques. Collaborative filtering is a popular approach in recommendation systems where recommendations are made based on the preferences of similar users or items.

## Dataset

The ratings data used in this project is sourced from the `ratings.csv` file from IMDb. The dataset contains information about user ratings for various movies. The data will be preprocessed and loaded into the surprise library's `Dataset` object for further analysis and modeling.

## Libraries Used

The scikit-surprise library is utilized in this project for collaborative filtering and prediction tasks. Scikit-surprise is a Python library specifically designed for building recommendation systems. It provides various collaborative filtering algorithms, evaluation metrics, and utilities for handling rating data.

## Usage

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script or Jupyter notebook to execute the recommendation system pipeline.

## Results and Evaluation

The success of the recommendation system will be evaluated using evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy of the predictions made by the models. Lower values of RMSE and MAE indicate better model performance.

## Conclusion

The movie recommendation system developed in this project aims to predict user ratings based on collaborative filtering techniques. By leveraging the scikit-surprise library, we can explore different collaborative filtering algorithms and evaluate their performance. This system has the potential to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and similarity to other users.
